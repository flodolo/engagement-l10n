;Dear [name],
Dear [name],


;2016 was a big year for the internet. Across the EU, we saw new laws, products, and trends — both good and bad — that impacted the internet’s health.

;2016 was also a big year for the open internet movement. That means you, Mozilla and everyone else fighting for a better web. We worked together to protect privacy and free expression online, and to fight against surveillance and exclusion online.

;And we’re proud of the work we’ve done with your support over the past 12 months. In the EU, we fought hard for copyright reform. We worked alongside you to share videos, collect signatures and send postcards to Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). We worked alongside you to fix copyright for the 21st century.

;Together, we accomplished amazing things. Over 100,000 citizens signed our copyright petition. And more than one million people engaged with our copyright videos. We’re so grateful.

;But there’s still work to do. In 2017, Mozilla will continue to fight for common sense copyright reform in the EU. We will tackle more issues, too. Like creating a more secure internet. And teaching web literacy to more citizens.
