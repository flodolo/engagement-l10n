;I am a strong and proud Muslim woman and I face a reality where I am not always welcome online, on certain platforms or in particular conversations. I’ve faced threats, harassing messages, unsolicited comments and invasions of my privacy. All while just trying to be me, and sharing my life.

;It’s my mission to give women the tools and resources that they need to protect themselves so they aren’t afraid to be themselves online. A healthy internet is one that is inclusive of our differences and allows everyone the opportunity to benefit from it.
