;Mozilla Foundation stands up for the health of the internet. We do this by empowering consumer action, connecting leaders, and fueling the movement.
Mozilla Foundation komt op foar de sûnens fan ynternet. Wy dogge dit troch konsuminte-aksje te stypjen, lieders te ferbinen en de beweging oan te jagen.


;Mozilla invests in bold ideas, global leaders, and the convening and campaign power of people. For more than two decades, we’ve worked across borders, disciplines, and technologies to fuel a movement to realize the full potential of the internet.
Mozilla ynvestearret yn nuodlike ideeën, wrâldlieders en de gearwurkings- en kampanjekrêft fan minsken. Al mear as twa desennia wurkje wy oer grinzen, disiplines en technologyen hinne om in beweging te stimulearjen om it folsleine potinsjeel fan ynternet te realisearjen.

;The internet is a vast ecosystem. Mozilla’s research — from our annual Internet Health Report to our white papers — make sense of all of it. We investigate threats to a healthy internet, from the explosion of online tracking, to increasing internet shutdowns, to the advent of deepfakes. But we also highlight bright spots and provide solutions, from the potential of open data to nascent social media cooperatives.
