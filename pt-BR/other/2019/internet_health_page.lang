Integridade da internet


;What do we mean by “internet health?”
O que queremos dizer com "saúde da internet?"


;A healthy internet is one in which privacy, openness and inclusion are the norms. These are values Mozilla has championed from the beginning in our <a>Mozilla Manifesto</a>.
Uma internet saudável é aquela em que privacidade, abertura e inclusão são as normas. Valores que a Mozilla defende desde o início em nosso <a>Manifesto Mozilla</a>.

;<strong>For over 4 billion people, the internet is an integral part of our everyday lives.</strong> It’s how we connect with our friends, families, co-workers and collaborators. It educates, entertains and provides access to goods and services. It’s the essential infrastructure powering business, commerce, and increasingly, society at large. For the 50% of the world that is not yet online, building a positive future online that is inclusive and accessible is key. <strong>The internet is a constantly evolving digital environment that shapes our lives and livelihoods.</strong>

;Mozilla believes that we all have a stake in understanding and protecting the health of the internet. For this reason, the Mozilla Foundation is primarily focused on <strong>fueling an emerging movement of internet users, academics, thought-leaders and activists who are standing and fighting for a healthy internet for generations to come.</strong>

;Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence
Inteligência Artificial Confiável


;In 2018, Mozilla identified the explosion of devices, platforms and products that include AI-enabled technologies as a key opportunity and threat to the health of the internet. After extensive research and deep consultation with allies, partners, industry, governments and civil society, we determined that stewarding and promoting “<a>Trustworthy AI</a>” was an urgent, critical issue directly related to internet health that we were uniquely positioned to take on. <strong>Mozilla has committed to direct the majority of our resources to this issue over the next few years.</strong>
