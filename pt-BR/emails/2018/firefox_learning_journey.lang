;Sometimes tracking can be okay, like when a company you buy from remembers what you look at on their site. But other kinds of trackers don’t care about you as a customer. Third-party trackers aren’t invited to the party at all, but they let themselves into your life, your connections and your interests. That puts your personal privacy at risk, because they’re trying to sell you.
