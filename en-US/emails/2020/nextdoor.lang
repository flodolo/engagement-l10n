;Without increased transparency into the nature of these partnerships, it’s impossible to tell what impact they might have on communities that are disproportionately targeted by police. Now that Nextdoor has made commitments to tackle issues with racism on the platform and ensure that all users feel welcome<sup>3</sup>, we have an opportunity to hold them accountable.

;We’re calling on Nextdoor’s CEO Sarah Friar to pause the company’s relationships with police departments globally until they can provide greater transparency into their partnerships with police and the steps they are taking to mitigate harmful impacts on communities they serve.

;Nextdoor markets their platform to police by highlighting how they can “geo-target messages to specific neighborhoods.” This is particularly concerning since there is very little public information that explains how this targeting works and which police departments Nextdoor has partnerships with. All this creates the potential for harm to be perpetrated against communities already disproportionately targeted by police.

;Thanks to pressure from activists<sup>4</sup> to hold Nextdoor accountable, the company has removed their “Forward to Police feature,” signaling that they recognize the need to slow down the porch-to-police pipeline enabled by technology like Amazon Ring and Nextdoor. Now we need to push them to put real change and accountability behind their words.
