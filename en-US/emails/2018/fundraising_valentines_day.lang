;You may have heard — it’s Valentine’s Day. A day for all things pink and sweet and love. Goodness, it’s awful.

;When my colleague — we’ll call him Cupid* — asked if I’d write a Valentine’s Day fundraising email (we’re a non-profit, we periodically have to ask for money to do the work that must be done to keep the internet healthy) my eyes rolled so hard they almost popped out of my head.

;It seems Cupid* — who is generally a really good guy — loves Valentine’s Day in all its sweet gooey pink flowery glory.

;Soon Cupid* and I were locked in debate. Do people love Valentine’s Day (Cupid’s take) or do they loathe it (my take)? I thought, let’s ask! Since this is a fundraising email, I’m asking you to vote with your dollars.

;Honestly, I’m not all Grinch when it comes to love. There are quite a few things I love about you — you’re on our email list, which means you care about the internet. I love people who love the internet. I love the internet too.

;Maybe you spoke up for an important issue recently — Net Neutrality, better digital privacy, maybe you taught someone how to do something online they didn’t know how to do — I love that too.
