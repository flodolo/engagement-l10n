;The Report, crafted by lead MEP on the file Terese Comodini Cachia, marks an improvement from the Commission’s original text in some areas - such as her proposal to restrict the so-called link tax - but many problems still remain, and the threat of online censorship in the name of copyright protection is still very real.

;Over the next few weeks, numerous amendments to the proposal will be discussed and decided. Various groups, such as major press publishers and the recording industry, are trying to restrict our Internet freedoms (for example, by mandating upload filters for everything you post on the web) and will be weighing in with their opinions. To keep our Internet healthy and protect our rights online, we need to counter those forces by telling members of this key committee how we feel on this topic.

;<b>Will you pick up the phone today and make a quick call to add your voice to the debate?</b> Every call will make a <b>big</b> difference. With so many powerful interests at play, it’s critical that the voice of Internet users like you who build, make, contribute, and tinker, are heard. We need to stand up for the open web and against online censorship.

;We are concerned that Article 13 would increase the liability of platforms and force them to filter and monitor everything we upload online. This would stifle creativity and create a prohibitive culture for innovation and expression online. In order to preserve openness and innovation online, Article 13 should be deleted.

;The proposal to introduce a new “neighbouring right for press publishers” would impede the sharing and accessing of news and information online. As suggested in the IMCO report, Article 11 should be removed from the proposal.

;Right now the proposal doesn’t include strong protections for user generated content. User generated content is a huge part of the Internet - whether for political commentary or for sheer comedic value. This was included in other reports, such as IMCO and CULT, and should be included in JURI too.
