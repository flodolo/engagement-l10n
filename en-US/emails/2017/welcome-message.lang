And while the Internet looks pretty great from the outside (thanks to all the social networking, video streaming and <a>cat gifs</a>) — we’ll keep you in the loop about what’s happening behind the scenes and how it can have a big impact on your online life.

;With a healthy Internet, we are all free to explore and discover and create and innovate without barriers or limitations. It’s where power is in the hands of many, not held by few. And our safety, security, and identity are respected. That’s the Internet we care about, and that you can play a big role in protecting.
