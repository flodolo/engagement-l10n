;Know what you are comfortable with.
Know what you are comfortable with.


;We all have different levels of concern about privacy and security. Understand where you and the person you are shopping for stand. The best way to do that is to have a conversation. Ask them how they feel about privacy and security when it comes to things that connect to the internet. <u>If you are shopping for children, ask their parents what they are comfortable with their kids having.</u>

;Do your research.
Do your research.


;Anything can be hacked — from the microphone on a talking doll, to a company’s cloud servers that store the personal information a device collects on you. It’s up to you to be aware if the gift you’re buying has a <i>camera</i>, <i>microphone</i>, or <i>tracks your location.</i> For most products, you can learn what you need to know by reading the product’s info page, privacy policy, and downloading the app it uses ahead of time to see how much access it asks of your phone or tablet. <a>We created a buyer’s guide to help you out.</a>

;Understand the risks.
Understand the risks.


;Not all risks are the same. Having the app your toothbrush uses track your location might sound weird. But if you mostly brush your teeth in your bathroom every day, that probably doesn’t pose too much of a risk. Putting always-on Internet-connected cameras inside and outside your house could open you up to being spied on in your most intimate moments. Weigh the risks of the connected gifts you are shopping for — and ask yourself before you buy, “Do I really need this to connect to the Internet?”
