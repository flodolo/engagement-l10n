Today, I’m asking you to <a>give to Mozilla</a>.</br>Why?


;For me, this has been a year of “why?” Why does the world feel so scary right now? Why does profit seem so much more important than our concerns for our friends and neighbors? Why can’t we all get along in our more connected, more informed world?

;So when I sit here and ask you for your hard earned dollars to help support the work and mission of Mozilla, that “why?” is at the very front of my mind.

;I once heard someone say, “When you think you can’t take anymore, give.” Give to your neighbor, your friends, your family, that stranger on the street who looks like they could use a smile. Giving heals.

;Yes, the world feels a bit scary right now. And fear is not a good guiding principle for us. It triggers our fight or flight response. Right now, we can’t flee from the problems facing us in the world, often exacerbated by the internet. All we can do is fight. Not with one another. But <i>for</i> one another!

;We must work together to fight for an internet that shares more good information than misinformation. For an internet that brings us together rather than tears us apart. For an internet that makes us all better able to take on the challenges in our world today that are so scary.

;So please, if you are able, consider giving to Mozilla today. Even just a small donation helps.
