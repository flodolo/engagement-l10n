;The internet has the potential to uplift society — it can promote democracy, open markets, and free expression. But it can also promote polarization, mass surveillance, and misinformation.
The internet has the potential to uplift society — it can promote democracy, open markets, and free expression. But it can also promote polarization, mass surveillance, and misinformation.


;More than ever, we need a movement to ensure the internet remains a force for good. Mozilla’s Fellowships and Awards fuel this movement by supporting individual and collective actions that advance a more human-centered internet. We provide funding, mentorship, and amplification to innovators of all types — from technologists and scientists to activists and artists. In turn, these individuals pilot ethical computer science curricula at leading universities. They track the spread of online disinformation and present their findings to top U.S. policymakers. They connect the unconnected in rural Tanzania using television white-space technology. And far more.
