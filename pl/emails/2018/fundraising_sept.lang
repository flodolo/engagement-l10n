;We’re in an urgent moment right now, where the issues we fight for are getting more and more attention every day. We’re uniquely positioned to make change — towards a healthier and more open internet, that respects the privacy and security of everyone that uses it. <strong>But we can’t do that without your support</strong>, so I hope you’ll chip in.

;We’re looking back on a great year so far, challenging Facebook and Amazon over their data practices, getting insecure connected toys off retailers’ shelves and we have data protection laws with teeth coming into effect in more and more countries.

;But it’s not all rosy when it comes to the health of the internet — things have been getting crazier for a while now, and more people are noticing. You can’t open Twitter or a news site in the US without seeing another serious story on election hacking. And disinformation is just one of the issues we see growing in seriousness — both in reality and in the public mind.

;This is our moment to really step up and step in. <a>Glyn Moody recently wrote in the Linux Journal</a> that, “Mozilla is probably the only organization capable of doing this credibly. It urgently needs to broaden and deepen its already substantial advocacy activities yet further — for the common good, and its own relevance.” And, we’re working on that.

;We’ve been using the notion of “internet health” to bring people together and grapple with what’s going on right now, and what can be done. We’ve gathered a posse of fellows who are doing everything from helping our allies use tech to defend human rights to helping the US Senate Intelligence Committee understand underlying algorithmic and cybersecurity issues that fuel disinformation. As the public looks to the tech companies and starts to ask questions, we’ve given people a channel to actually ask these companies to make changes to their products. Almost every time we’ve done this, we’ve won.

;We will continue to stay the course: focusing on the issues of the day; finding more allies to collaborate with; and honing the programs we've built over the last few years.
