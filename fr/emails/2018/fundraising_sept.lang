;We’re in an urgent moment right now, where the issues we fight for are getting more and more attention every day. We’re uniquely positioned to make change — towards a healthier and more open internet, that respects the privacy and security of everyone that uses it. <strong>But we can’t do that without your support</strong>, so I hope you’ll chip in.

;From all of us here at Mozilla… THANKS!
De la part de tout le monde chez Mozilla… MERCI !


;Welcome back from summer! (Or winter, for those of you in the Southern Hemisphere.)
Bienvenue à tous, après l’été (ou l’hiver pour ceux de l’hémisphère Sud) !


;We’re looking back on a great year so far, challenging Facebook and Amazon over their data practices, getting insecure connected toys off retailers’ shelves and we have data protection laws with teeth coming into effect in more and more countries.
Regardons en arrière sur une belle année jusqu’à maintenant, qui a vu l’utilisation des données de Facebook et Amazon contestée, des jouets connectés non sécurisés retirés des rayons des commerçants et des lois sur la protection des données, plus incisives, entrées en vigueur dans de plus en plus de pays.


;But it’s not all rosy when it comes to the health of the internet — things have been getting crazier for a while now, and more people are noticing. You can’t open Twitter or a news site in the US without seeing another serious story on election hacking. And disinformation is just one of the issues we see growing in seriousness — both in reality and in the public mind.
Mais tout n’est pas idyllique quant à la santé d’Internet — les choses deviennent de plus en plus insensées depuis un certain temps et davantage de gens s’en rendent compte. Vous ne pouvez ouvrir Twitter ou un site d’informations aux États Unis sans tomber sur une nouvelle histoire grave de piratage des élections. Et la désinformation n’est qu’un des problèmes que nous voyons croître en importance — à la fois en réalité et dans l’esprit du public.


;The issues Mozilla, our allies and our community have been talking about for almost two decades have become both urgent and broadly known.
Ces problèmes dont Mozilla, nos alliés et notre communauté parlent depuis quasiment vingt ans, sont devenus à la fois urgents et largement connus.

;This is our moment to really step up and step in. <a>Glyn Moody recently wrote in the Linux Journal</a> that, “Mozilla is probably the only organization capable of doing this credibly. It urgently needs to broaden and deepen its already substantial advocacy activities yet further — for the common good, and its own relevance.” And, we’re working on that.
Le moment est venu pour nous de vraiment intensifier et approfondir notre action. <a>Glyn Moody a récemment écrit dans le Linux Journal</a> que « Mozilla est probablement la seule organisation en capacité de faire cela de manière crédible. Elle se doit, de toute urgence, d’élargir et d’approfondir encore ses activités pourtant déjà substantielles de mobilisation — pour le bien commun et sa pertinence. » Et c’est à cela que nous nous attelons.


;We’ve been using the notion of “internet health” to bring people together and grapple with what’s going on right now, and what can be done. We’ve gathered a posse of fellows who are doing everything from helping our allies use tech to defend human rights to helping the US Senate Intelligence Committee understand underlying algorithmic and cybersecurity issues that fuel disinformation. As the public looks to the tech companies and starts to ask questions, we’ve given people a channel to actually ask these companies to make changes to their products. Almost every time we’ve done this, we’ve won.

;We will continue to stay the course: focusing on the issues of the day; finding more allies to collaborate with; and honing the programs we've built over the last few years.

;So, there you go. Times are crazy. The opportunity is big. We’re well teed up. Let’s keep it moving forward. Simple, right? :)
