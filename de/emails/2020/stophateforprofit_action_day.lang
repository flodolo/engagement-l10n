;Facebook is still a place where it’s too easy to find hate, bigotry, racism, antisemitism and calls to violence. After Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg met with our partners, it was clear that it was going to require more to get them to take this issue seriously.

;But so far, Facebook’s response to the #StopHateForProfit campaign has been insufficient and we all need them to do more. Facebook is still feeling the heat after allowing hateful incitements to violence in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, and its own civil rights audit says Facebook is woeful at dealing with hate speech and misinformation rampant on its platform.

# “With great power comes great responsibility” is a famous quote from the Spiderman movie
;With great power comes great responsibility: Every day, people use Facebook to learn about issues affecting our society and interact with each other – and need a safe space to do so. Without concrete action, the hate speech and disinformation on Facebook will continue to tear at the fabric of society.
